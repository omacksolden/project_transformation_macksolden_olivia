# Resources

I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

# Comments

This assigment was really fun and learning the basics of responsive design is going to be super helpful. Watching the responsive design lecture and looking back at my repo from coding along with the lecture helped me so much with this assignment. I think I'll definitely need more practice with it but overall, I enjoyed playing around with the browser and seeing the changes come to life.
